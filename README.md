If you need assistance on troubleshooting or isolating a problem, you can request a remote assistance session through our [Support Ticket](https://www.telerik.com/account/support-tickets) system. Remote Assistance is included in the [DevCraft Ultimate](http://www.telerik.com/purchase/kendo-ui) subscription.

### I need a tailor-made solution

Our aim is to provide the most versatile and proven set of application building blocks. Still, depending on the functionality you desire, some assembly is required.

The [Progress Services](https://www.progress.com/services) team is available to assist in building functional blocks or complete applications according to your specification. They will help you make the most of Kendo UI while freeing you to work on the real business problems.
