                Tallinn is the capital and largest city of Estonia. It is situated on the northern coast of the country,
                on the shore of the Gulf of Finland, 80 km (50 mi) south of Helsinki, east of Stockholm and west of
                Saint Petersburg. From the 13th century until 1918 (and briefly during the Nazi occupation of Estonia
                from 1941 to 1944), the city was known as Reval. Tallinn occupies an area of 159.2 km2 (61.5 sq mi) and
                has a population of 443,894. Approximately 32% of Estonia's total population lives in Tallinn.

                Tallinn was founded in 1248, but the earliest human settlements are over 5,000 years old, making it one
                of the oldest capital cities of Northern Europe. Due to its strategic location, the city became a major
                trade hub, especially from the 14th to the 16th century, when it grew in importance as part of the
                Hanseatic League.
