# IntegrationI18n

This project demonstrates how to use Angular i18n and Kendo UI for Angular components in an Angular application. For more information, refer to the [Translation of Messages](https://www.telerik.com/kendo-angular-ui/components/globalization/localization/messages) and [Angular Internationalization](https://angular.dev/guide/i18n) articles.

## Development server

To run the different i18n configurations, you can use the following commands:

```bash
ng serve --configuration=es
```

```bash
ng serve --configuration=de
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.
